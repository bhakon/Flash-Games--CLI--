# Flash Games (CLI)-
 These are the games that we used to play in childhood with pen and paper . I tried to implement them as it is but with command line interface (CLI)

They are :-

 - Cows And Bulls 
 - Hang The Man 
 - Mind Reader 


COWS AND BULLS : 
===============

The game is played between two people. Both of them selects a 4-digit numbers.

criteria for selecting numbers :
- There must be no repeating digits 
- The number must not contain 'ZERO'

COWS :
- If the original number and guessed number have common digits , but they are not having same place value (i.e they are not in same place)

BULLS:
- If the original number and guessed number have common digits and they are having same place value (i.e they are at same place)


Both players guess the other player number and other player gives the information of cows and bulls of the guessed number.
This process goes on... and the player who first guesses the correct number is the winner .

but here the other player won't play the game , it generates the number and gives you the cows and bulls information . with your calculations from that info you have to guess the number in a limited number of chances.



HANG THE MAN :
==============

A random word is selected and the length of word is given. 
you have eight chances to guess the word letter by letter.
if you correctly guessed the letter then there is no change in no.of chances you have otherwise a chance is reduced.



MIND READER :
============

You have to select a number .
Apply the math to the number as suggested by the computer .
Your final result is displayed on the screen.
